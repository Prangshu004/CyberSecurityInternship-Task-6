# 🔐 Cybersecurity Internship – Task 6 Report

## 📌 Task Title:
**Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength**

---

## 🧠 Objective:
To understand the factors that contribute to a strong password by creating multiple passwords of varying complexity, testing them using online strength checkers, and identifying best practices to prevent password-based attacks.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used:
- [passwordmeter.com](https://www.passwordmeter.com/)
- [How Secure Is My Password](https://howsecureismypassword.net/)
- Manual strength analysis based on entropy, length, and character diversity

---

## 🧪 Experiment Steps:

### 🧩 Step 1: Created Passwords of Varying Complexity

| Password             | Type                        | Characters Used                     |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `password123`        | Weak (common)               | Lowercase, numbers                   |
| `P@ssw0rd!`          | Moderate (predictable)      | Mixed case, symbol, number           |
| `G#f9@kT2$Lz!#bV1`   | Strong (complex/random)     | Upper, lower, numbers, special chars |
| `MyDogEats#Pizza2025`| Strong (passphrase hybrid)  | Words + symbols + numbers            |

---

### 🧩 Step 2: Tested Using Strength Checkers

**Using passwordmeter.com and howsecureismypassword.net**

| Password             | Strength (%) | Crack Time Estimate      | Notes                          |
|----------------------|--------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `password123`        | 18%          | < 1 second                | Common and guessable           |
| `P@ssw0rd!`          | 52%          | ~3 minutes (brute-force)  | Better, but still predictable  |
| `G#f9@kT2$Lz!#bV1`   | 100%         | 10+ million years         | Excellent complexity and length|
| `MyDogEats#Pizza2025`| 91%          | 1+ billion years          | Strong and memorable           |

## 📋 Summary of Password Security Tips:

- ✅ Use **at least 12–16 characters**
- ✅ Combine **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters**
- ✅ Avoid **dictionary words**, names, or patterns (`qwerty`, `1234`)
- ✅ Use **passphrases** for better memorability
- ✅ Consider using a **password manager** to generate and store strong passwords
- ✅ Enable **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** wherever possible

## 🔐 Common Password Attacks:

| Attack Type           | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Brute Force Attack** | Attempts all possible combinations                                         |
| **Dictionary Attack**  | Uses precompiled list of common words and passwords                        |
| **Credential Stuffing**| Uses leaked credentials from breaches to access other accounts             |
| **Phishing**           | Tricks user into revealing password                                        |

---

## 🧠 Concepts Learned:

- Password strength depends on **length + entropy**, not just symbols
- **Short passwords** can be cracked even if complex-looking
- **Passphrases** balance security and memorability
- Password managers reduce the risk of reusing weak credentials
